This academic year 2022-2023 we have had a student doing his internship in Dusseldorf, Germany. This week the professor of the Laboratory training cycle, Jaime Usano, traveled there to tutor our student Nitai on site.

This contact of the teacher with the reception centers is essential to establish long-term collaboration ties, improve the stay and training of the students and, ultimately, promote the Erasmus project at IES Jaroso.

We love seeing students working in companies in this way, and tutors so happy.
