The training cycles at IES Jaroso are in luck, our Erasmus+ project to train, learn and live an international experience is now a reality.

9 mobilities for our vocational training cycles: Web Applications Design, and Guide, Information and Tourist Assistance. In total 27 months to distribute.

We could not be happier.
