Four students from IES Jaroso, Adama, Sarafina, María José, and Francina, from Vocational Training cycles in Laboratory, Administrative Management, and Welding, have just left the final Erasmus+ meeting and are already prepared to embark on this exciting Erasmus adventure. Soon, a student from the Higher Degree in Web Application Development will also join them. We wish them the best in this unique experience!
