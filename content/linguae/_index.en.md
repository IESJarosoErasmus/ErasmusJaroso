Language support can be done in two ways: 
1. Online Linguistic Support [(OLS)](https://erasmusplusols.eu/es/).  This platform, provided by the Erasmus+ agency, will comply with the availability conditions indicated by IES Jaroso.
2. Other types of language support for those aspects not covered by the OLS (or if the OLS is not available):

    - [IdiomasGratis](https://www.idiomasgratis.net/)
