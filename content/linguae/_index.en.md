Language support can be done in two ways: 

1. Online Language Support (OLS). This platform, provided by the Erasmus + organization, will abide by the availability conditions indicated by the IES Jaroso. It helps Erasmus + mobility participants learn languages ​​and offers Erasmus + participants the opportunity to assess their skills in the foreign languages ​​they will use to study, work or volunteer abroad.
