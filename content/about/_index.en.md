### What is the Erasmus+ programme? 
The Erasmus+ programme aims to meet the teaching and learning needs of all participants in formal higher education and vocational training of middle and higher grades, as well as the institutions that provide this type of training. This programme focuses on formal and informal learning in a foreign country, with a clear vocation of internationalization opening up to other countries with the aim of improving the educational and educational capacities of people for the employability of students, teachers and workers.    

For IES JAROSO, this project will be our first erasmus world inclusion from the perspective of Vocational Training. We have chosen students and teachers as the first participants for this exciting experience. With this, we hope, on the one hand, to motivate our students and offer them the possibility to live new experiences and develop their skills both personal and professional; and on the other hand, to equip our teachers with new tools that allow them to train better professionals and educate students in the highest values of democratic, respect and citizenship, on which the European dream is based.  

We hope that these Erasmus projects will become a decisive factor in the dynamization of both the academic life of the Centre and that of the region itself. Forming more and better graduates, bringing new business ideas, reducing school dropout and promoting integration and democratic values are, among others, some of the fruits we hope to obtain from this initiative. With all this, we hope to be able to contribute our grain of sand in improving the conditions of the region, and therefore, that of its inhabitants.  
  
We are convinced of the success of this Project, and of course, we want to involve everyone in it, so that we can make ourselves known both at the local, regional and European level, and if possible, encourage others to participate in this experience, sharing what is learned along this shiny new path that opens up before us.
